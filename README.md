# DIST-S1 Research

Notebooks to provide trade studies and visualizations for developing the final OPERA `dist-s1` algorithm

## Install

```
mamba env update -f environment.yml
conda activate dist-s1
python -m ipykernel install --user dist-s1
```

## Notes

Create your own directory with your last name and do as you please. Don't mess with other people's work. This is a poorly versioned controlled repository and meant to provide sample code and prototypes that can be distilled down later.
